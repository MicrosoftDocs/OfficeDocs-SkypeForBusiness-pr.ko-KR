# <a name="facilitate-user-adoption-of-your-new-online-phone-system"></a>새 온라인 휴대폰 시스템의 사용자 채택을 활용 하세요.

전화는 사용자의 수명선 일 수 있습니다. 기존 전화 시스템에서 온라인 전화기 시스템으로 전환 하는 것은 사용자의 업무 방식에 상당한 변화가 있으므로 생산성에 부정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 이러한 변화를 통해 사용자에 게 알려주기, 가이드, 지원 등의 작업을 수행 하면 사용자 환경을 개선 하 고 투자 수익률을 최대화할 수 있습니다.

이 문서에는 사용자에 게 새 전화 시스템에 대해 알려줄 수 있는 사용자 지정 가능한 전자 메일 서식 파일이 포함 되어 있습니다 적절 한 전자 메일을 사용자 지정 하 여 특정 음성 배포에 맞게 보냅니다. 간단한 개인 설정을 위해 섹션을 표시 하는 대괄호를 사용 했지만 사용자에 게 가장 적합 한 알림을 만들려면 조직 관련 메시징을 추가 하는 것이 좋습니다. 배포에 해당 되는 경우 "팀"에 대 한 모든 참조를 "비즈니스용 Skype"로 바꿉니다.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT about your office desk phone
```

전자 메일의 본문:

```
Instant messaging and online meetings have become a common way to communicate
with others, but your phone can still be a lifeline to getting your job done.
From building rapport when you can’t be there in person to maintaining momentum
on a project, sometimes it’s easier to just pick up the phone and talk to
someone. At the same time, we understand that many of you work remotely, have
flexible work schedules or travel frequently and can’t be tethered to your
desk or phone all day.

To better adapt to how you work, we want to ensure you have flexibility in how
you communicate including being able to make and receive phone calls from
anywhere, at any time. We're excited to announce that you'll soon be able
to use Microsoft Teams as your phone. This upgrade will provide
instant messaging, online meetings and phone calling all in one application,
simplifying the way you work.

Using Teams as your phone offers...

-   Flexibility - Make and receive calls anywhere, any time, across
    devices

-   Adaptability - Easily move between your headset and a variety of
    devices, including mobile

-   Capability - Transfer calls to an internal contact, external number or
    even your voicemail

-   Productivity - Call your contacts with one click, alleviating the need
    to remember phone numbers

When will phone calling be available?

We understand this is a big shift in the way you make calls today and want to
ensure you have everything you need to get started. Phone capabilities will be
enabled on <INSERT DATE>, but you can start preparing today.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your new phone system is live
```

전자 메일의 본문:

```
Welcome to your new phone system. Your Microsoft Teams application
has been enabled with phone calling capabilities. You should now see a dial pad
tab on your client, enabling you to make outgoing calls and listen to
your voicemail. When a call comes in, you'll receive an alert, just like you
would for an instant message. Just select the alert to answer the call – it’s
that easy!

CALL TO ACTION

*  Plug in your headset, go to the Calls tab, and either
   call a contact or use the dial pad to make a call. 

*  Start a chat, and escalate it to a call.

With the launch of phone calling capabilities in Teams, we'll be
recycling your old phone, allowing for more real estate on your desk.
